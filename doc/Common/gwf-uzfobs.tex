UZF & water-content & iuzno or boundname & depth & Unsaturated-zone water content at a user-specified depth (ID2) relative to the top of GWF cellid for a UZF cell. The user-specified depth must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the thickness of GWF cellid (TOP - BOT). If boundname is specified, boundname must be unique for each UZF cell.
