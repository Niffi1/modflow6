This is the unsaturated zone-stream-aquifer interaction example problem (test simulation 2) from the Unsaturated Zone Flow Package documentation (Niswonger and others, 2006).  This problem is simulated using the Unsaturated Zone Flow (UZF) and Streamflow Routing (SFR) Packages in MODFLOW 6. UZF Package runoff and groundwater discharge to the surface are not routed to the SFR Package.
