This is a relatively large model with 580K cells.  The hydraulic conductivity field is highly heterogeneous to test convergence properties of the solver.  Constant heads are assigned to the left and right sides of the model to drive flow from left to right.  There are three stress periods.  The first stress period is steady state to equilibrate to the initial conditions; the second stress period is transient with 10 time steps and with a pumping well in the center of the domain; and the third stress period is steady state with the pumping well active.
