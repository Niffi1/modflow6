This example is included in the XT3D documentation.  It is a 3D extension of
test006_gwf3_disv_trimesh2_xt3d that demonstrates the ability of the "XT3D"
option to accurately simulate 3D anisotropic flow.  All cells adjacent to the
outer boundary of the model domain are constant-head cells with heads that
correspond to a uniform, left-to-right gradient.  Hydraulic conductivities
are set to achieve 10:5:1 anisotropy rotated 45 degrees ccw from the x axis
and 30 degrees upward from the horizontal plane.
