#Test problem from USGS Techniques and Methods 6 A-16.  Cells 1,10,14 and
#  3,6,12 given a large transmissivity, and HFB is used to cause the
#  transmissivity to be essentially the same as before.
#  For layer 1, K is .001.  The barrier width will represent half a cell
#  (2500 ft), so HYDCHR=.001/2500.
#  For layer 3, K is .0002, so HYDCHR is .0002/2500.
