3D problem with a pumping well in the middle in bottom layer.
Constant head all around domain in layer 1.
Confined
IDOMAIN used to remove layer 2.
So we compare a 3 layer mf2015 model with a 2 layer mf2005 model.  Ipython notebook shows the difference.  The compare hds file is from the mf2015 simulation that matched with the mf2005 simulation.
