This is the stream-aquifer interaction example problem (test 1) from the Streamflow Routing Package documentation (Prudic and others, 1989).  This problem is simulated using the Streamflow Routing (SFR) Package in MODFLOW 6. The connection between reach 2 and 3 in the SFR Package has been removed and the MVR Package is used to move streamflow from reach 2 to 3.
