This is a variant of the unsaturated zone-lake-stream-aquifer interaction example problem (test simulation 2) from the Unsaturated Zone Flow Package documentation (Niswonger and others, 2006) that includes a two layer aquifer and two lakes connected to the stream network, and UZET is simulated using the capillary pressure formulation (UZF Option UNSAT_ETAE).  This problem is simulated using the Unsaturated Zone Flow (UZF), Lake (LAK), and Streamflow Routing (SFR) Packages in MODFLOW 6. The Mover (MVR) Package is also used to exchange water between the UZF, LAK, and SFR Packages.
