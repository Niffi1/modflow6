This is the unsaturated zone-stream-aquifer interaction example problem (test simulation 2) from the Unsaturated Zone Flow Package documentation (Niswonger and others, 2006).  This problem is simulated using the Unsaturated Zone Flow (UZF) and Streamflow Routing (SFR) Packages in MODFLOW 6. The Mover (MVR) Package is also used to exchange water between the UZF and SFR Packages.
