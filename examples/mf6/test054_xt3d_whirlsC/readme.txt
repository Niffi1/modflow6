This example is included in the XT3D documentation.  The “XT3D” option is
used to implement anisotropy that induces groundwater whirls in a highly
idealized two-aquifer system.

This is the third of three cases.  It involves rotation of the conductivity
tensor both within and out of the horizontal plane.  Interestingly, flow
lines reverse direction as they progress from one end of the model domain
to the other.
