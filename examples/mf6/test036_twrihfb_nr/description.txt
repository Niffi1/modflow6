This problem is included with the MODFLOW-2005 examples and is documented in USGS Techniques and Methods 6 A-16 (Harbaugh, 2005). Quasi-3D layers are not supported in MODFLOW 6 so quasi-3D confining beds in the original problem are discretized as model layers with a low horizontal hydraulic conductivity. The BCF Package in the original example was converted to a LPF Package prior to conversion. This problem also uses the Newton-Raphson formulation.
