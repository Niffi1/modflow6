This is the steady-state lake-aquifer interaction example problem (test simulation 1) from the Lake Package documentation (Merritt and Konikow, 2000).  This problem is simulated using the Lake (LAK) Package in MODFLOW 6 and uses the lake table option to define the relation between stage, surface area, and volume.
